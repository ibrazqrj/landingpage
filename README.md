<b>📋 Description</b>
---
I have created my own landing page for the first time, showcasing my personal profile and contact information.

<b>🔖 The Landingpage</b>
---
I've integrated my biography from GitHub and my social media links into the landing page, keeping it in a simple black and white design, which is intentionally basic yet effective.
